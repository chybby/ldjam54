# Picky Plants

You just got home from the garden centre with a new haul of plants for your
favourite hobby: terrarium building!

These plants seem rather picky about how they're planted though (and you're
not sure all of them are actually plants...)

How to play:

- `Left Click` on a plant to pick it up.
- `Left Click` a space in the terrarium to place the plant.
- Place all the plants in the terrarium to complete the level, though you need
  to make sure all the plants are happy with how they're placed.
- `Esc` or `P` to open the settings menu while playing.
